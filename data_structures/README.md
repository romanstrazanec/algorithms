## Stack

A stack (sometimes called a “push-down stack”) is an ordered collection of items where the addition of new items and the removal of existing items always takes place at the same end. This end is commonly referred to as the “top.” The end opposite the top is known as the “base.”

Methods:

- isEmpty -> True if empty
- push    -> push item to the top
- pop     -> remove item from the top
- peek    -> get item at the top
- size    -> size of the stack
